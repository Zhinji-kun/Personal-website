            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at University of Perpetual Help System-Dalta Molino. I've always had a passion for Programming. Ever since high school, I was fascinated by how you can make games, and others apps by commanding a computer. That curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, I know it will be a challenging journey, but I know I will learn more as I go through this. I will never regret this</p>
            <p>My goal in life is to make an AI that could help humanity on exploring space, Actually I wanted to be an astronaut first but I had my strength and weaknesses and those strength does not fit in being an astronaut, but I can stay behind and created an AI that could help guide humanity to a greater future.</p>
            <p>During pandemic I learned coding by doing online courses like from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a></p>
            <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>I got my Diploma in University of Perpetual Help System-Dalta Molino</p>
            <p>I passed NCII in Animation and got my first National Certificate at TESDA</p>
