            <p>I'm Rai Zhinji G. Tamondong, a 1st year BS Computer Science student at University of Perpetual Help System-Dalta Molino.</p>
            <p>I specialize in Web development, and Programming.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite quotes is "I believe in the me who believes in me" - Simon the digger(from Gurren Lagann), This quote speaks to my heart as it has motivated me to keep on going even if I can't believe in someone, I know there's a part of me that believes in what I can do. Even if everything I do is bad doesn't mean it'll get worse</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore more about my journey in the <a href="about.html">"About"</a> section or get in touch with me via the <a href="contact.html">"Contact"</a> page!</p>
